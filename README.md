🌡️ Regression Model for Predicting Temperature


This project involves building a regression model to predict temperature using features from the weatherHistory dataset. The dataset contains weather-related data from 2006 to 2016, including temperature and other related features. This project showcases the complete pipeline of developing a machine learning model, leveraging both Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression to achieve the best results.


📊 Project Overview
Objective: Predict temperature using five key features from the dataset.
Dataset: weatherHistory dataset (2006–2016), containing weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
Techniques Used:
Linear Regression: A baseline model for predictions.
Polynomial Regression: To capture non-linear relationships and improve performance.


🛠️ Project Phases
This project covers all phases of the machine learning model lifecycle:

Data Exploration:

Conducted an initial analysis to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
Handled missing and noisy data.
Feature Engineering:

Selected the five most relevant features for predicting temperature.
Scaled and prepared data for training.
Model Building:

Implemented Linear Regression as the baseline model.
Enhanced the model using Polynomial Regression to address non-linear relationships.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Compared the performance of linear and polynomial models.


📈 Results
The model demonstrated good accuracy in predicting temperature.
Polynomial Regression showed better results than Linear Regression by capturing more complex patterns in the data.
